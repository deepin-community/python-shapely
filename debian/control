Description: geometric objects, predicates, and operations (Python 3)
 Shapely is a package for manipulation and analysis of 2D features.
 Its capabilities include:
  * calculating the point set unions, intersections, or differences of features
  * predicate tests on features: intersects, touches, contains, and more.
 .
 Supported geometric types are points, line strings, linear rings, polygons, and
 homogeneous or heterogeneous collections thereof.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the package.
